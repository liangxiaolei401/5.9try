一、观察和发现Observations and Findings<br>
（1）年例（来自现有文献的）的既有知识与基于调查和数据收集的观察进行比较<br>
A comparison between established knowledge about Nianli (from existing literature) and my own observations based on my survey and data collection<br><br><br>
在文献中，大量文献提及年例祭祀与冼太夫人之间的关系。年例祭祀是纪念冼太夫人。在收集到的数据中可以发现，年例祭祀确实与冼太夫人有关。但是更具体来说，每个地方都有自己祭拜的神，在当地来说是“公”。例如沙院镇的十三位天神大帝：玄天上帝、玄天北帝、康皇大帝、哪吒三太子、关帝、大王、华光大帝、平乐公、平乐奶、福德公、福德奶、华山公、华山奶；陈村街道的北帝公；旦场镇的尊王境主、英德夫人，地主王宫人等<br>
In the literature, a large number of studies mention the connection between the Nianli sacrifice and Xian Tai. The Nianli sacrifice is said to commemorate Xian Tai. Based on the data collected, it can be found that the Nianli sacrifice is indeed related to Xian Taijun. But more specifically, each place has its own deities for worship, locally referred to as "Gong." For example, in Shayuan Town, there are thirteen Tian Shen Da Di: Xuantian Shangdi, Xuantian Beidi, Kang Huang Dadi, Nezha Sandaizi, Guandi, Da Wang, Huaguang Dadi, Ping Le Gong, Ping Le Nai, Fude Gong, Fude Nai, Huashan Gong, and Huashan Nai. In Chencun Subdistrict, there is Bei Di Gong. In Danchang Town, there are Zun Wang Jingzhu, Yingde Furen, and Di Zhu Wanggongren.<br><br>
在文献中，大量文献提及电白年例的共性，却很少提及电白各镇的不同。在收集到的数据中可以发现，各镇之间的习俗有细微差别，例如在年例流程方面是有差别的，南部区域盛行“走公”，东部区域盛行“抢炮头”，西部区域盛行“摆桌面”等。<br>
In the literature, there is a lot of mention of the commonalities of the Nianli in Dianbai, but few studies mention the differences among various towns in Dianbai. However, based on the data collected, it can be found that there are subtle differences in customs among different towns. For example, there are differences in the Nianli process. In the southern region, "Zou Gong" is popular. In the eastern region, "Qiang Paotou" is popular. In the western region, "Bai Zhuomian" is popular.<br><br>
在文献中，提及到年例中会有粤剧和歌舞演出。在收集到的数据中可以发现更多的细节，例如，各地会根据村里的财力去邀请戏班，邀请“广东省粤剧院一团”表演一晚需要十二万左右的人民币，本地村民都会引以为豪。在歌舞方面，有些老板会直接捐赠一晚上的歌舞。村里会挂出横幅，将捐赠唱戏或歌舞的村民的名字和金额挂在村里显眼的位置，只要捐赠的人都会被挂上去表扬，即使金额不多。<br>
In the literature, it is mentioned that there will be Yue Opera and song and dance performances during the Nianli. However, based on the data collected, more details can be found. For example, each village will invite opera troupes according to its financial strength. Inviting the "Guangdong Province Yue Opera Troupe One" to perform for one evening costs about 120,000 RMB. Local villagers take great pride in this. In terms of song and dance, some bosses will directly donate a night of song and dance performances. The village will hang banners, displaying the names and amounts of villagers who donate performances or song and dance in a conspicuous place in the village. Anyone who donates will be listed for praise, even if the amount is not large.<br><br>
在文献中，提及到的习俗是比较常见的，而一些比较小众的习俗没有提及，例如马嘶村扔糖果的习俗等。<br><br>
In the literature, the customs mentioned are relatively common, while some less common customs are not mentioned, such as the custom of throwing candies in Mashicun.<br><br><br>
（2）电白年例区域差异，以收集的地图和调查数据为例。<br>

在收集到的数据中可以发现，各镇之间的习俗有细微差别。南部区域盛行“走公”，东部区域盛行“抢炮头”，西部区域盛行“摆桌面”，在<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToVisualizations()">可视化图表</a>一页中有详细介绍。<br>

二、反思Reflection<br><br>
年例是粤西地区重要的传统民俗文化活动，具有深厚的历史渊源和独特的文化内涵。它不仅是茂名地区历史文化传承的重要载体，也是社会交往、文化创新的平台。从上述文本中，总统上看，年例的未来会是蓬勃发展的。虽然在疫情中面临三年的停滞，2023年恢复年例到现在虽然各地摆宴席的规模有所减小，但传统习俗还是受到重视的，各地村民们依旧保持做年例的习俗，更有一些地方在年例时候展示自己本土开放包容，热情好客的文化。年例能从以前发展到现在自然有它能够长久发展的道理。<br>
联合国可持续发展目标高度重视传统文化的作用，年例作为粤西地区的重要传统文化活动，是当地文化多样性和社区凝聚力的重要体现。通过保护和传承年例，可以增强社区的归属感和身份认同，促进社会的和谐与包容。年例作为地方性传统节日，是社区文化的重要组成部分。通过举办年例活动，能够增强社区居民的文化认同感和归属感，促进社区的凝聚力和可持续发展。例如，电白年例通过组织各种庆祝活动，吸引当地居民广泛参与，成为社区文化的重要纽带。
年例的保护和传承有助于维护地方文化的多样性，符合可持续发展目标中关于文化遗产保护的要求。电白年例作为当地特有的文化遗产，其保护和发展对于维护地方文化生态具有重要意义。<br>
The Nianli is an important traditional folk cultural activity in the western part of Guangdong Province, with a profound historical background and unique cultural connotations. It is not only an important vehicle for the inheritance of historical and cultural traditions in the Maoming area but also a platform for social interaction and cultural innovation. From the above text, it can generally be seen that the future of the Nianli will be vibrant. Although it faced a three-year hiatus during the pandemic, since its resumption in 2023, despite a reduction in the scale of banquets in various places, traditional customs are still highly valued. Villagers in different areas continue to maintain the tradition of holding the Nianli, and some places even showcase their local open-mindedness, inclusiveness, and warm hospitality during the Nianli. The Nianli has naturally developed from the past to the present for its own reasons of long-term sustainability.
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals place great emphasis on the role of traditional culture. As an important traditional cultural activity in western Guangdong, the Nianli is an important manifestation of local cultural diversity and community cohesion. By protecting and inheriting the Nianli, a sense of community belonging and identity can be enhanced, promoting social harmony and inclusiveness. As a local traditional festival, the Nianli is an important part of community culture. By holding Nianli activities, the cultural identity and sense of belonging of community residents can be strengthened, and the cohesion and sustainable development of the community can be promoted. For example, the Dianbai Nianli, through organizing various celebratory activities, attracts widespread participation from local residents and becomes an important bond of community culture.
The protection and inheritance of the Nianli contribute to maintaining local cultural diversity and meet the requirements for cultural heritage protection in the Sustainable Development Goals. The Dianbai Nianli, as a unique cultural heritage of the region, is of great significance for maintaining the local cultural ecosystem.
