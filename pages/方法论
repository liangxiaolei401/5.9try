数据收集的方法Data Collection Methods<br><br>
<br>文献综述Literature Review<br>
本人通过查找相关文献、文章和报告来了解有关年例的内容。主要是通过中国知网查找文献，通过搜狐网查找文章。将提及次数高的言论和本人对家乡年例的了解做出数据的筛选。<br>
I have conducted research on the Nianli by searching for relevant literature, articles, and reports. I primarily used CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) to find literature and Sohu website to search for articles. Based on the research, I have filtered the data by identifying the most frequently mentioned opinions and combining them with my own understanding of the Nianli in my hometown.<br>
<br>问卷调查法Surveys and Questionnaires<br>
本人通过腾讯文档(https://wj.qq.com/)来发布调查问卷，在收集到的问卷中国72.9%的被调查者来自于电白区。在得出的结果中吗，游神，宴客，祭神和歌舞粤剧是年例中最常见的角色。而抢炮头，飘色等活动只占了8.2，因此对这些少数的活动做了调查，并将结果发布在了“可视化图表”一页中。<br>
I have published a survey questionnaire through Tencent Document (<https://wj.qq.com/>). Among the collected responses, 72.9% of the respondents are from Dianbai District. In the results, You Shen (游神), Yan Ke (宴客), Ji Shen (祭神), and Ge Wu and Cantonese opera (歌舞粤剧) are the most common activities during the Nian Li (年例). However, activities such as Qiang Pao Tou (抢炮头) and Piao Se (飘色) only account for 8.2%. Therefore, I conducted a survey on these minority activities and published the results on the "Visualization" page.<br>

<br>采访法Interview<br>
本人通过线上采访电白地区的公民，从他们口中了解年例的一些习俗和看法。<br>
I conducted online interviews with citizens from the Dianbai area to understand some of the customs and their views on the Nianli through their own words.<br><br>
社交媒体Social Media<br>
本人通过社交媒体抖音获取数据，在搜索了大量的图片和视频后，将获得同意的材料运用到此网站上。<br>
I obtained materials through the social media platform Douyin. After searching for a large number of pictures and videos, I used the materials that had been granted permission from posters on this website.<br><br><br>
